summary::Library developed by me, Ian, to support Musical Compositing.
categories::Libraries>CodexIan

Description:: 
CodexIan is a library of classes and extensions for SuperCollider that establish a workflow for using modular composite objects in the service of music composition (or whatever else). In other words, the library is tasked with compositing music compositions, which just as well should be called musical musical compositing.

section::Guides
definitionlist::
##link::Guides/MusicalCompositing::
||A guide that describes the library's primary functions.
::
section::CodexComposites
definitionlist::
##link::Classes/CodexComposite::
||The base class for all composite objects. 
##link::Classes/CodexHybrid::
||A subclass of teletype::CodexComposite:: that handles hybrid objects.

section::Utilities
These are classes that are used internally by the composites, but have broader uses too. 
definitionlist::
##link::Classes/CodexProcessor::
||Manages the loading and unloading link::Classes/SynthDef##SynthDefs:: from the server. 
##link::Classes/CodexTemplater::
||Creates templates of emphasis::.scd:: files at a target location.  
##link::Classes/CodexCache::
||Manages a cache for storing the modules of subclasses of CodexComposite.
::

subsection::Path Management
These utilities deal specifically with managing paths on the system.
definitionlist::
##link::Classes/CodexPaths::
||Persistently stores paths that can be accessed via link::Classes/Symbol:: keys.
##link::Classes/CodexIncrementer::
||Generates incrementally advanced file names within a given directory.
