DESCRIPTION::
link::Classes/CodexProxier:: is a subframework of link::Guides/CodexIan:: that focuses on manipulating data within a link::Classes/ProxySpace::. In this way, as opposed to a class like link::Classes/CodexHybrid::, which might be considered instrumental, CodexProxier offers a more compositional approach.
