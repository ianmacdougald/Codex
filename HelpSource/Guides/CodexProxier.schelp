DESCRIPTION::
link::Classes/CodexProxier:: is a subframework of link::Guides/CodexIan:: that focuses on manipulating data within a link::Classes/ProxySpace::. CodexProxier was designed to extend the functionality of link::Classes/CodexComposite:: in a way that facilitates music composition. On its own, CodexProxier simply loads modules that evaluate code within the ProxySpace environment it stores. These modules are evaluated using the method link::Classes/CodexProxier#-engage#-engage::. The sequencing of these patterns over time is the responsibility of its subclassesâ€”link::Classes/CodexSonata:: and link::Classes/CodexMovement::. The former uses a link::Classes/Task:: to manage the timing between sections while the latter uses patterns. A description of how to work with all three classes as well as how they are implemented is the purpose of the current guide.
