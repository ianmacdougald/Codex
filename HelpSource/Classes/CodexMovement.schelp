DESCRIPTION::
CodexMovement is one part of a music-making development kit along with link::Classes/CodexSymphony::. Specifically, an instance of CodexSymphony sequences CodexMovement objects, and CodexMovement inherits from link::Classes/CodexComposite::. As such, each movement of the symphony can be redefined in a moduarlized fashion per the procedures defined by link::Guides/CodexIan::.

CodexMovement works by sequencing modules in a pattern. As a result, it is not advisable to write data that should persist between movements of a symphony. And yet, each movement can be independelty reconfigured within a symphony.
