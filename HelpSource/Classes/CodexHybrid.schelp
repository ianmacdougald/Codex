DESCRIPTION:: 

CodexHybrid aims to streamline the development of hybrid composite classes, namely those that straddle SuperCollider's link::Guides/ClientVsServer##client-server architecture.:: Specifically, CodexHybrid manages the loading and unloading of link::Classes/SynthDef##SynthDefs:: so that other CodexHybrid-typed classes can easily call related link::Classes/Synth##Synths:: with minimal issues relating to link::Guides/Sync-Async##asynchronicity between the client and the server::. It does this by combining the procedures of link::Classes/CodexComposite:: with the services of link::Classes/CodexProcessor::.

note::Like CodexComposite, CodexHybrid itself should not be instanced. Doing so will probably throw an error. To see the class's features in action, refer to link::Classes/HybridExample::.
