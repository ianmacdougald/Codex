DESCRIPTION:: 

teletype::CodexHybrid:: aims to streamline the development of hybrid composite classes, namely those that straddle SuperCollider's link::Guides/ClientVsServer##client-server architecture.:: Specifically, CodexHybrid manages the loading and unloading of link::Classes/SynthDef##SynthDefs:: so that other CodexHybrid-typed classes can easily call related link::Classes/Synth##Synths:: with minimal issues relating to link::Guides/Sync-Async##asynchronicity between the client and the server::. It does this by combining the procedures of link::Classes/CodexComposite:: with the services of link::Classes/SynthDefProcessor::.

note::Like teletype::CodexComposite::, teletype::CodexHybrid:: itself should not be instanced. Doing so will probably throw an error. To see the class's features in action, refer to link::Classes/CodexHybridExample::.

private::new

private::initCodexHybrid
private::subDictionaryExists
private::addSubDictionary
private::addToDictionary

method::dictionary
Gets the dictionary of teletype::SynthDefs::.

method::hybridDictionary
Gets the dictionary containing all of the subdictionaries teletype::CodexHybrid:: is currently storing. 

method::removeAt
Removes a single SynthDef from the server. 
argument::key 
The name of the SynthDef to remove.

method::removeAll
Removes all of the class's teletype::SynthDefs::.

method::clearCodexHybrids
Removes all of the teletype::SynthDefs:: from every other active hybrid.

method::formatName
Formats a teletype::SynthDef's:: link::Classes/SynthDef#-name#name:: to include the link::Classes/Class#-name#name:: of the class. This is used internally to prevent clashes between names. However, it can be useful for calling teletype::Synths:: when scripting.
