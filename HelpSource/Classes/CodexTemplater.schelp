DESCRIPTION::
CodexTemplater creates emphasis::.scd:: files with code templates for the following classes:

list::
## link::Classes/SynthDef::
## link::Classes/Pattern::
## link::Classes/Function::
## link::Classes/Synth::
## link::Classes/Event::
## link::Classes/Array::
::

However, if a situation arises in which a composite needs templates from different objects or combinations of objects, like a function that returns an array of events, CodexTemplater can be easily link::#Extending CodexTemplater#extended::.

CodexTemplater was originally designed to work within the link::Classes/Composite:: framework. To see it in action, refer to this link::Guides/MusicCompositing##guide::.
CLASSMETHODS::

method::new
Creates a new instance of CodexTemplater.

argument::moduleFolder
A string that refers to the folder in which templates will be generated.

private::modulePathString
private::moduleTemplateDir
private::makeTemplate
private::copyFile
private::firstToLower
private::targetCopy
private::templateDir
private::defaultPath

INSTANCEMETHODS::
private::makeTemplate
method::setTemplateDir
Sets the path where the class looks for templates to copy.
method::resetTemplateDir
Resets the path where the class looks for templates to copy to the default location.

method::path
Gets and sets the path where new templates are to be stored.

subsection::Templating methods
method::synthDef
Creates a template of a SynthDef object.

method::pattern
Creates a template of a Pattern object.

method::function
Creates a template of a Function object.

method::synth
Creates a template of a Synth object.

method::event
Creates a template of an Event object.

method::array
Creates a template of an Array object.

method::blank
Creates an empty emphasis::.scd:: file

method::makeExtTemplate
Makes an arbitrary template from a folder anywhere on the machine.
argument::templateName
The name of the template to be generated.
argument::object
A string containing the name of the file (without the extension) containing the template.
argument::
A path to the folder containing the object.

EXAMPLES::

code::
(
var path, templater;

//1. Set up a path.
path = "~/Desktop/_templateTest".standardizePath.mkdir;

//2. Load the path into a CodexTemplater.
templater = CodexTemplater.new(path);

//3. Make templates for SynthDef.
templater.synthDef;
templater.synthDef("anotherSynthDef");

//4. Make templates for Function.
templater.function;
templater.function("anotherFunction");

//5. Inspect the file names.
//(Look at and delete the folder from the desktop too.)
PathName(path).files.do{|item|
	item.fileName.postln;
};
)

//6. Clean up.
File.deleteAll("~/Desktop/_templateTest".standardizePath);
::

If one tries to make a template at a location where a template with the same name already exists, the class automatically link::Classes/FileIncrementer##increments:: the name starting with 1.
code::
(
var path, templater;

//1. Set up a path.
path = "~/Desktop/_secondTemplateTest".standardizePath.mkdir;

//2. Load the path into a CodexTemplater.
templater = CodexTemplater.new(path);

//3. Make templates of a Patttern.
templater.pattern("dupTest");
templater.pattern("dupTest");
templater.pattern("dupTest");

//4. Inspect the file names.
PathName(path).files.do{|item|
	item.fileName.postln;
};
)

//5. Clean up.
File.deleteAll("~/Desktop/_secondTemplateTest".standardizePath);

section::Extending CodexTemplater
Because sitautions may arise in which it is necessary to have templates for objects not defined by default, CodexTemplater can be easily extended to include new templates. The procedure for doing so requires two stepsâ€”writing a new template and writing an extension method for CodexTemplater that makes it.

By default, CodexTemplater looks for templates in the directory where the class is implemented. However, if new templates are written somewhere else, CodexTemplater must be directed to them. This is done by calling the method link::Classes/CodexTemplater#-makeExtTemplate:: as demonstrated below:

code::
+ CodexTemplater {

	//This method will generate an arbitrary template from anywhere on the machine.
	customTemplate { | templateName("custom") |
		this.makeExtTemplate(
			templateName,
			"nameOfTemplateFile_NoExtension",
			"Folder/With/New/Templates",
		);
	}

}
