DESCRIPTION::
teletype::CodexComposite:: establishes a workflow both for developing and interacting with composite objects, namely those which are comprised of interconnected scriptable modules. CodexComposite is responsible for maintaing a directory that each of its subclasses populates with their own modular collections. 

Moreover, teletype::CodexComposite:: defines an interface for easily manipulating these collections, allowing new modules to be generated from templates (see link::Classes/Templater::), cloned from existing collections, and also both loaded and reloaded without recompiling teletype::sclang::. In this way, each teletype::CodexComposite::-typed class is free to focus on defining interesting interactions between modules rather than dealing with the pesky details of their storage and organization.  

note::teletype::CodexComposite:: is a development tool that should not be instantiated. Rather, it is meant to encapsulate behaviors on behalf of its subclasses. So instance those instead.
::

CLASSMETHODS::

method::new
Creates a new instance.

argument::moduleSet
A teletype::symbol:: key representing the name of the set of modules to call. This key will correspond to a folder of modules within teletype::CodexComposite's:: directory.

argument::from
A teletype::symbol:: key representing the name of the folder to clone if the folder from teletype::moduleSet:: does not exist.

private::establish
private::defaultDirectory
private::checkDefaults
private::folderManager

method::classFolder 
Gets the directory of modules maintained by a given subclass of teletype::CodexComposite::. 

method::moduleSets
Gets the names of the teletype::moduleSets:: that currently exist.

method::directory
Gets and (persistently) sets the directory of modules for all subclasses of teletype::CodexComposite::. For further details, see link::Classes/PathStorage::.
note::Before using a subclass of teletype::CodexComposite:: for the first time, be sure to configure the path to the modules directory either through teletype::CodexComposite:: or one of its subclasses.::
code::
CodexComposite.directory_("~/Documents/sc-modules".standardizePath);
::

INSTANCEMETHODS::
private::getModules
private::initCodexComposite
private::getModuleSet

method::moduleFolder
Gets the current directory of modules loaded into the instance. 

private::processFolders
private::makeModuleFolder
private::makeTemplates

method::loadModules
Loads (or reloads) the modules pointed to by the instance's module folder. 

method::modules
Gets an event containing the loaded modules. 

private::getModuleName

method::moduleSet
Gets and sets the current teletype::moduleSet::. 
argument::newSet
A teletype::symbol:: specifying the new set of modules to load. Setting teletype::moduleSet:: will in turn load the new resources. 

argument::from
A teletype::symbol:: referring to an existing set of modules to copy if the new module name does not exist yet.
