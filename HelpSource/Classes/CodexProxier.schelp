DESCRIPTION::
CodexProxier is tasked with managing modules that evaluate code within the link::Classes/ProxySpace:: that it stores. These modules are referred to using the key section. By default, every new set of modules generated from templates (see link::Guides/CodexIan::) will create only one section. More can be added using the method link::Classes/CodexProxier#-makeSection#-makeSection::. Sections themselves are engaged using the method link::Classes/CodexProxier#-engage#-engage::. 

CodexProxier does not offer any functionality to manipulate sections over time. This is accomplished by its subclass, link::Classes/CodexSonata::, which uses a link::Classes/Task:: to sequence scripts. link::Classes/CodexSymphony:: was developed in order to manipulate Proxier-typed link::Classes/CodexMovement:: objects. In other words, CodexSonata is a sequencer while CodexSymphony is a meta-sequencer of these sections. For more on this, refer to each respective documentation.

INSTANCEMETHODS::
private::collectSections
private::initComposite
private::initProxier
private::moduleSet

method::proxySpace
Gets the ProxySpace object held within the class.
method::server
Gets and sets the reference to the server stored in the ProxySpace. 
Setting this will clear the ProxySpace.
method::clear
Clears the proxy space object and evaluates the cleanup method.
method::cleanup
Iterates through a list of functions added within the modules for cleaning up resources like link::Classes/Buffer##Buffers::.
method::sections
Gets the keys representing the names of the modules that are sections. 
method::makeSection
Adds a new section template to the link::Classes/CodexComposite#-moduleFolder#folder of modules:: and link::Classes/CodexComposite#-reloadScripts#reloads the scripts::.
