DESCRIPTION::
CodexSymphony and its associated class, link::Classes/CodexMovement::, together establish a framework for making music that relies on the procedures of link::Classes/CodexComposite::. While CodexSymphony itself does not inherit from CodexComposite, it was designed to sequence collections of CodexMovements, which do. As a result, a piece of music defined in this framework can be modularly developed on a movement-by-movement basis.
