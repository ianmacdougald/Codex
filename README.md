# Codex 

The Codex quark establishes a framework for developing modular class interfaces using arbitrarily defined scriptable components. A class developed in this framework can support any number of diverse configurations without compromising its functionality. It aims to support a best-of-both-worlds situation that balances the specficity of a compiled class's interface with the open-ended potential of scripting.
