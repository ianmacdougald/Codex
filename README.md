# CodexIan 
A (growing) library of classes and extensions for SuperCollider that (currently) covers issues 
relating to managing folder paths persistently and filenames dynamically. Extensions to *SCLang* 
aid this. 

### Installation
In SuperCollider, evaluate the following: 

`Quarks.install("https://github.com/digi-synth/CodexIan")`
